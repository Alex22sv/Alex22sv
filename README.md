I'm Alexander from El Salvador. I like to create programs, mostly websites but I've also developed Discord bots in the past. Recently I've started developing Minecraft plugins. I'm interested on working on new and innovative projects. I can work alone and with teams. My native language is Spanish but I can fluently speak and understand English. In my free time I like to play videogames (mostly CoD and Hollow Knight) but also listen to Lofi music.
